The last project I worked on was a large-scale web application with complex interactive features such as dynamic user interactions, real-time updates, and customizable UI elements. Our team consisted of six developers. We used React for the frontend, Zustand for state management, Framer Motion for smooth animations, and Firebase for authentication via social networks.

It was an existing codebase when we joined, so our main goal was to maintain consistent coding standards and architecture while introducing new solutions to improve performance and scalability. At first, integrating social network authentication was quite challenging, as it was completely new area for our team, but we managed to handle it successfully and deliver a stable implementation. Overall, it was a valuable experience that helped me deepen my understanding of frontend architecture and team collaboration.

I'd also like to mention another project - a casual 2D browser game where the player controls an archer who has to hit targets behind obstacles. We developed it from scratch, handling both the core game logic and UI. I was responsible for building and optimizing interactive UI components, implementing animations, and integrating the gameplay logic with the interface. Among the most interesting features were split, portal, and homing arrows.

We faced some difficulties synchronizing animations and game logic, but after refining our approach, we successfully completed a beta version that performed smoothly across devices.

The last project I worked on was a large-scale web application with a lot of interactive features — dynamic UI elements, real-time updates, and social network authentication. Our team had six developers. On the frontend, we used **React** with **Zustand** for state management, **Framer Motion** for animations, and **Firebase** for social login.

It was an existing codebase, so one of our main tasks was to maintain consistent coding standards while also improving performance and introducing new solutions. Integrating social network authentication was initially challenging since it was a new area for the team, but we successfully implemented it. Overall, this project gave me valuable experience in working with a complex frontend architecture and collaborating within a team.

Another project I worked on was a casual 2D browser game where the player controls an archer hitting targets behind obstacles. We built it from scratch, and I was mainly responsible for interactive UI components and animations. Some of the interesting mechanics included **split**, **portal**, and **homing arrows**. We faced some challenges syncing animations with the game logic, but after refining our approach, we delivered a smooth and stable beta version.
