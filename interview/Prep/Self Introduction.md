> Hello and thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to get on call and introduce myself to you today!

> My name is Slava. I'm a frontend developer with 5 years of experience. I have been working on diverse projects in different domains such as <...> and with different technologies such as <...>.

> As for my experience as a team member, I've worked in small, local teams, as well as large, international teams, sometimes working as a stand-alone developer (independent maybe).

> I've joined projects in different stages of development, such as projects that were started from scratch, as well as joining projects that were already in-flight.

> I'm also familiar with a range of Agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, and feel comfortable working with either.

> So this is my short introduction, if you'd like I can tell you more about my last project or my greatest achievement in the career.
