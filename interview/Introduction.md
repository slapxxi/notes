## Self Intro

Hi, I’m Slava, a Front-end Developer with 5 years of experience focused on building performant, maintainable, and user-friendly web applications.

I’ve worked across domains such as e-commerce and B2B platforms, delivering both internal dashboards and customer-facing applications.

I’ve collaborated with distributed teams in Europe and the US — from larger front-end groups of 10+ engineers, and also on projects where I took full ownership of the front end. I’m comfortable working cross-functionally with designers, product managers, backend developers, and QA, typically in Scrum or Kanban environments.

My core tech stack includes React, TypeScript, Zustand, React Router, NextJS, and React Query. I also have experience with testing frameworks like Jest (Vitest) and Playwright, as well as working in modular architectures such as feature-sliced design. For styling, I’m confident with Tailwind CSS, ShadCN, CSS Modules, and plain old CSS.

That’s it from my side. You are free to ask any questions or I can tell you about my last project.

## Last Project

My most recent project was a CV Management Application, a web platform designed for HR teams and professionals to create, organize, and manage CVs more efficiently.

The goal of the project was to provide a centralized system where users could build CVs, track their skills and language proficiencies, and manage multiple CV versions for different roles, reducing manual work and ensuring consistency.

I worked in a team of 3 — including two frontend devs , and a team lead. We followed a a simplified version of Agile with two-week sprints, weeklies and pull request reviews.

The tech stack included React, TypeScript, Tanstack Router for routing, React Query for data fetching, and Tailwind CSS with MUI** for styling. For testing, we used **Jest and React Testing Library.

My responsibilities involved discussing and building core features, collaborating with a fellow frontend developer, ensuring code quality through reviews and tests .

Some of the key features I delivered included the **skills, languages and cv management modules**, where users could create and edit multiple CVs with different set of parameters/projects.

As a result, the application streamlined the CV creation process, gave users flexibility to maintain role-specific versions, and provided HR teams with a more structured way to evaluate candidate profiles.
