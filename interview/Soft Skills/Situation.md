Perfect 👍 Let’s continue with the **Situation** block. I’ll keep the answers structured, concise, and natural for spoken English (so they don’t sound memorized).

## ✅ Situation Questions & Suggested Answers

**Q: What will you do if your manager is not available, and you don't have tasks on the project?**  
I’d first check the backlog or documentation for pending tasks. If nothing is available, I’d use the time for self-improvement — for example, improving test coverage or refactoring. And of course, I’d update the manager about my availability once they’re back.

**Q: What if you need to explain to junior dev why should we split one file to smaller ones?**  
I’d say: _“When a file is too big, it becomes harder to understand, test, and reuse. Splitting it into smaller files makes the code cleaner, easier to maintain, and reduces the chance of breaking unrelated parts when making changes.”_

**Q: What if you've been assigned a task but you don't have enough requirements?**  
I’d contact the product owner or business analyst for clarification before starting. If they’re not immediately available, I’d prepare a list of assumptions and confirm them later to avoid going in the wrong direction.

**Q: Have you ever missed deadlines? What happens if you miss it?**  
Yes, it happened once due to underestimated complexity. I immediately informed the team, explained the blockers, and proposed a new timeline. For me, transparency is key — it helps maintain trust.

**Q: If the customer says that the task is to be completed tomorrow, but you understand that it’s impossible, what will you tell the customer?**  
I’d explain the effort required and the risks of rushing, then suggest either prioritizing the most critical part for tomorrow or negotiating a realistic deadline.

**Q: What if you have a conflict with another developer?**  
I’d first talk one-on-one to understand their perspective. If we still can’t agree, I’d suggest involving a tech lead or PM to find a compromise.

**Q: What if you have an unfinished task, can you describe the process of transferring this task to another developer?**  
I’d document the current progress, push the latest code, add clear comments in the task tracker, and explain dependencies or blockers. If possible, I’d also give a short handover call.

**Q: What if the task you've been assigned can't be completed by the deadline?**  
I’d raise the issue early, explain what’s blocking me, and propose either splitting the task into smaller deliverables or negotiating more time.

**Q: Are you usually successful in completing each milestone by its deadline? What are the common obstacles for failing a task?**  
Yes, most of the time. The main obstacles are unclear requirements, unexpected technical complexity, or dependencies on other teams. I try to mitigate this by asking clarifying questions early.

**Q: Have you ever finished ahead of schedule? Do you report about it or keep silent?**  
Yes, I always report it. Finishing early allows the team to re-prioritize and tackle the next task sooner.

**Q: You have specified that you are a good team worker and a quick learner, so tell me why?**  
I adapt quickly to new codebases and technologies — for example, I picked up Zustand and React Query during my last project in just a few days. As a team member, I keep communication transparent, help others during code reviews, and share knowledge when I find useful practices.
