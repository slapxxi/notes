**Q: How do you rate yourself from 0 to 10?** **Q: How do you rate yourself from 0 to 10?**  
I’d say around **7.5 to 8**. I’m confident in React, TypeScript, and front-end architecture, but I leave room for growth because I’m always learning and improving.

**Q: How do you upgrade/improve your skills?**  
I usually learn by building side projects, reading official documentation, and following updates from the React and TypeScript ecosystems. I also watch conference talks, and sometimes contribute to refactoring tasks in projects to try out new approaches.

**Q: Your weaknesses and strengths**  
Strengths: structured problem-solving, attention to code quality, and strong collaboration with designers and backend developers.  
Weakness: sometimes I can spend too much time polishing details. I’ve learned to balance “good enough” with deadlines by aligning more often with the team.

**Q: Which project was the most difficult/interesting?**  
The most interesting was the **CV Management Application**. It was challenging to build flexible CV templates and skills/languages modules in a reusable way, but it was also rewarding to see how it simplified the workflow for users.

**Q: What motivates you? / Why do you like software development?**  
I enjoy turning ideas into working applications and solving problems that make users’ lives easier. The fast-paced evolution of frontend also keeps me motivated, because there’s always something new to master.

**Q: What was your last project? How long was this project? Was it in a foreign company?**  
My last project was a **CV Management Application**, it lasted around [X months]. It was for an international company, and I collaborated with distributed teams across different time zones.

**Q: Do you know anything about our project/application/platform?**  
Yes, I looked into it before the interview. From what I understood, [insert research-based fact about their product]. I see it as an interesting challenge because [reason it matches your skills].

**Q: Can you describe one of your greatest achievements?**  
On my last project, I developed the **CV builder and skills management module**. It became a core feature, and the team recognized it as one of the most valuable parts of the product because it directly improved HR workflows.

**Q: What were your activities during the bench?**  
I used the time to strengthen my skills — I focused on improving my TypeScript and testing knowledge, and I built a small side project to practice Zustand and React Query.

**Q: What do you like doing in your free time? What are your personal interests?**  
I enjoy cooking and experimenting with recipes. I also like playing video games and reading about software architecture and design patterns.

**Q: Why did you decide to become a software developer?**  
Because I enjoy problem-solving and creating things that people can interact with. It combines logic with creativity, and I find that balance very rewarding.

**Q: What is your ideal project?**  
An application with clear business goals, modern technologies, and a collaborative team where we can balance good engineering practices with delivery speed.

**Q: If you had two similar tasks, how would you prioritize them?**  
I’d clarify with the product manager which one has higher business value. If both are equally important, I’d choose the one that unblocks more dependencies.

**Q: How much time did it take you to get back on track?**  
Usually not long — if I get stuck, I break the problem into smaller steps, or ask for feedback early to avoid delays.

**Q: Can you describe your fail?**  
Once, I underestimated the time needed for implementing a complex API integration. I learned to involve backend early and adjust estimates after clarifying requirements.

**Q: Will it be interesting for you to work on our project?**  
Yes. From what I know about your platform, it’s a domain where I can apply my React/TypeScript expertise, while also growing in [domain-specific topic].

**Q: Как вы подходите к адаптации с точки зрения кодовой базы, процессов и динамики команды?**  
Я сначала изучаю архитектуру проекта и документацию, общаюсь с коллегами о код-стайле и правилах. Потом активно участвую в процессах команды, чтобы быстрее войти в ритм.

**Q: Можете ли вы привести личный пример проблемы, с которой вы столкнулись, и как вы ее решили?**  
На одном проекте я столкнулся с отсутствием документации API. Я предложил вести минимальную wiki с описанием основных эндпоинтов и начал заполнять её сам. Это сильно ускорило работу команды.

**Q: Что вам кажется наиболее сложным в работе с другими людьми?**  
Иногда разные ожидания по приоритетам. Чтобы избежать конфликтов, я стараюсь прояснить цели и фиксировать договоренности в таск-трекере.

**Q: What's the ideal team for you?**  
A team with open communication, shared responsibility for quality, and where developers, designers, and product managers collaborate closely.
