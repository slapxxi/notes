## ✅ Processes Questions & Suggested Answers

**Q: Tell me about Scrum**  
Scrum is an Agile framework where the team works in **sprints** (usually 1–2 weeks). It includes ceremonies like sprint planning, daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. The idea is to deliver small, incremental value and adjust based on feedback.

**Q: Tell me about Kanban**  
Kanban is a visual method where tasks flow through stages (To Do → In Progress → Done). It’s flexible, doesn’t enforce fixed iterations, and helps manage workload by limiting tasks in progress.

**Q: How do you estimate a task?**  
I usually break it into smaller subtasks, check complexity, dependencies, and unknowns. Then I give an estimate in story points or hours. If there’s uncertainty, I flag it early.

**Q: What methodologies have you worked with?**  
Mostly Agile — Scrum and Kanban. I’ve also worked in hybrid setups where planning was Scrum-like, but daily work followed Kanban.

**Q: What is your experience with team size and project management methods (e.g. Scrum)?**  
I’ve worked in small squads of 3–6 developers and in larger teams of 10+. In both cases, we followed Agile — with Scrum sprints in small teams and more Kanban-like flow in larger, distributed teams.

**Q: How did you communicate with customers: texted, called up?**  
Mostly through written communication in Jira/Slack and demo calls. I also participated in refinement sessions where we clarified requirements directly with the client.

**Q: Have you ever participated in demo calls?**  
Yes. I’ve demoed features I built, explained how they worked, and answered client questions about technical limitations or possible improvements.

**Q: Which one would you choose: management or development? Explain.**  
Development. I enjoy coding, problem-solving, and building UI features. But I also like to take part in technical discussions and mentoring, so a mix of technical ownership and development would be ideal.

**Q: What would you advise your colleague who was falling behind a schedule?**  
I’d first ask if they need help. Sometimes pair programming or breaking down the task helps. If needed, I’d also suggest raising it with the team early to adjust priorities.

**Q: What is your attitude to overtiming?**  
I believe overtime should be an exception, not the norm. If it happens occasionally to meet a critical deadline, I’m fine with it. But I think proper planning should prevent regular overtime.

**Q: Are you progressing on schedule right now? Do you have to report about your progress?**  
Yes, I usually update progress daily in standups and on Jira boards. Transparency helps the team track blockers and dependencies.

**Q: Is sticking to a schedule an easy thing in your job?**  
Not always, because requirements can change or tasks can be more complex than expected. But with good estimation and communication, it becomes manageable.

**Q: Have you ever had to catch up after falling behind schedule?**  
Yes, in one sprint where a feature took longer than planned. I caught up by focusing on the highest-priority parts first and collaborating with teammates to unblock dependencies.

**Q: Were you involved in long-term or short-term projects? Which ones do you prefer and why?**  
Both. Short-term projects are dynamic and you learn fast, but I prefer long-term projects because they allow me to design maintainable architecture and see the product grow.

**Q: How did you handle overlap on your last project?**  
We coordinated through daily standups and clear ownership of tasks in Jira. If two people worked on related features, we synced via quick calls or pair programming to avoid conflicts.

### More Process-specific

**Q: What did you mean pointing that you have been reviewing application requirements and interface designs?**  
I participated in refinement sessions where we discussed business requirements and gave feedback from the technical side — for example, whether a UI flow was realistic to implement within time constraints.

**Q: You have been participating in refinement and design sessions, but what did you exactly do?**  
I asked clarifying questions, suggested technical approaches, and sometimes proposed UI adjustments to make components more reusable.

**Q: Have you ever failed your estimation and why did it happen?**  
Yes, mainly due to hidden complexity in API integration. I learned to flag uncertainties and add buffer time when estimating.

**Q: How was the testing process organized?**  
We wrote unit and integration tests with Jest/React Testing Library. QA engineers focused on manual testing and E2E tests. Bugs were tracked in Jira and addressed during the sprint.

**Q: What do you usually do when you can't handle some really difficult task?**  
I break it into smaller parts, do some research, and if I’m still stuck, I ask for help from a more experienced teammate. Collaboration usually leads to a solution faster.

Got it 👍 I’ll translate all the **Russian parts from the Processes section** into **English** while keeping the answers concise and natural for interviews.

### 🔄 Translations

**Q: How do you approach adaptation in terms of codebase, processes, and team dynamics?**  
I start by studying the project’s architecture and documentation, then I talk with teammates about coding style and rules. After that, I participate actively in team processes to get into the rhythm quickly.

**Q: Can you give a personal example of a problem you faced and how you solved it?**  
On one project, there was no API documentation. I suggested creating a minimal wiki with descriptions of the main endpoints and started filling it in myself. It significantly sped up the team’s work.

**Q: Was there documentation on the project and how was it organized?**  
Yes, we had a wiki in Confluence and README files in the repository. We also documented APIs with Swagger.

**Q: What does clean code mean to you?**  
Readable, modular, and maintainable code without duplication. Clear naming, consistent style, and test coverage.

**Q: What would you improve on your previous project?**  
I’d strengthen the testing process by adding more automated E2E tests to reduce manual QA effort.

**Q: Your strengths and weaknesses**  
Strengths — structured thinking, attention to quality, teamwork.  
Weakness — sometimes I spend too much time polishing details.

**Q: How do you communicate with the team?**  
Through Slack and Jira for async communication, and daily calls for synchronization.

**Q: What do you enjoy most in your work?**  
Turning an idea into a working application and seeing how my code actually helps people.

**Q: What are you interested in developing now?**  
Performance optimization in React applications and architectural approaches like micro-frontends and feature-sliced design.

**Q: What do you consider a good task description?**  
When a task has a clear goal, definition of done, described requirements, and ideally a mockup or API contract.

**Q: How did you interact with designers?**  
We discussed mockups in Figma. I clarified responsive design details and edge cases. Sometimes I suggested simplifications to speed up development.

**Q: The team was in different time zones, how did the work go?**  
We used async channels in Slack and Jira comments. Key meetings were scheduled at times convenient for everyone.

**Q: How did you interact with the Product Owner and on what topics?**  
We discussed feature priorities, clarified business goals, and refined requirements. Sometimes I suggested alternative solutions if they were faster or simpler to implement.

**Q: Do you have leadership experience?**  
Yes, on one project I helped onboard new developers and did code reviews for them.

**Q: Who inspires you and why?**  
I’m inspired by colleagues who can explain complex things in simple terms and who balance speed with quality. It motivates me to grow into that kind of developer.

**Q: What specific difficulties did you face during work and how did you solve them?**  
On one project, documentation was missing. I started building a knowledge base in a wiki, and teammates joined in. It made onboarding new developers much easier.

**Q: What rules or processes seemed unnecessary or useless during the project?**  
Sometimes meetings were too long. I suggested setting strict time limits and moving detailed discussions to async channels.

✅ Now all answers are in **English only**, polished for interview use.

Do you want me to also **go back and translate the Russian answers from the Common section** (“Как вы подходите к адаптации…”, “Можете ли вы привести…”, etc.) so everything is 100% in English?

**Q: Была ли документация на проекте и как организована?**  
Да, была wiki в Confluence и README-файлы в репозитории. Также мы документировали API в Swagger.

**Q: Что для тебя clean code?**  
Читаемый, модульный и легко поддерживаемый код, без дублирования. Хорошие имена переменных, единый стиль, покрытие тестами.

**Q: Что бы ты улучшил на предыдущем проекте?**  
Я бы усилил процесс тестирования — добавил больше автоматизированных E2E тестов, чтобы уменьшить ручную проверку.

**Q: Твои сильные и слабые стороны**  
(повторяем кратко) Сильные — структурное мышление, внимание к качеству, командная работа. Слабые — иногда слишком тщательно довожу детали.

**Q: Как ты коммуницируешь с командой?**  
Через Slack/Jira для асинхронной работы и через ежедневные звонки для синхронизации.

**Q: От чего ты кайфуешь в работе?**  
От того, что можно превратить идею в рабочее приложение, и от того, что мой код реально помогает людям.

**Q: Что тебе сейчас интересно развивать?**  
Оптимизация производительности React-приложений и архитектурные подходы — micro-frontends, FSD.

**Q: Какое описание задачи ты считаешь хорошим?**  
Когда у задачи есть четкая цель, критерии готовности (Definition of Done), описанные требования и, по возможности, макет или API контракт.

**Q: How can you explain some tech question to non-technical person?**  
I use analogies. For example, if explaining caching: _“It’s like keeping a shopping list on your fridge instead of going to the store every time you need to check what you need.”_

**Q: Как взаимодействовал с дизайнером?**  
Мы обсуждали макеты в Figma, я уточнял детали адаптивности и возможные edge-cases. Иногда предлагал упрощения, чтобы ускорить разработку.

**Q: Команда в разных часовых поясах, как проходила работа?**  
Мы использовали асинхронные каналы в Slack и комментировали задачи в Jira. Основные митинги проводили в удобное для всех время.

**Q: Взаимодействие с PO, как и по каким вопросам?**  
Обсуждали приоритеты фич, уточняли бизнес-цели и спорные требования. Иногда предлагал альтернативные решения, если они быстрее или проще в реализации.

**Q: Имеешь ли опыт лидерства?**  
Да, на одном проекте я помогал новым разработчикам в онбординге и ревьюил их код.

**Q: Кто тебя вдохновляет и почему?**  
Меня вдохновляют коллеги, которые умеют просто объяснять сложные вещи и находят баланс между скоростью и качеством. Это мотивирует самому становиться таким разработчиком.

**Q: Какие трудности были конкретные во время работы и как ты их решал?**  
На проекте не хватало документации. Я начал собирать базу знаний в wiki, и постепенно подключились коллеги. Это облегчило работу новым разработчикам.

**Q: Какие правила или процессы казались глупыми/ненужными во время работы на проекте?**  
Иногда слишком долгие митинги. Я предложил ограничивать их временем и обсуждать детали асинхронно.
