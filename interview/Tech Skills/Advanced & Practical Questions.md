1. How do you ensure accessibility in your frontend code?

   > By using semantic HTML, proper ARIA roles, alt attributes, keyboard navigation, and testing with screen readers. Accessibility isn't optional - it's part of good UX.

2. How do you handle state management in a large React app?
   > I prefer libraries like Zustand or Redux Toolkit for predictable state handling, combined with React Query or SWR for server state. The key is to avoid prop drilling and keep local and global state well separated.
