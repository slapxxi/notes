**Q: Explain the critical rendering path.**

> It's the sequence of steps the browser follows to turn HTML, CSS, and JS into pixels on the screen. Optimizing it involves reducing blocking resources, inlining critical CSS, and deferring non-essential scripts.

**Q: What's event delegation?**

> Event delegation leverages event bubbling by attaching a single event listener to a parent element to manage events on its child elements dynamically.

**Q: How do you optimize frontend performance?**

> By code-splitting, lazy-loading components, minimizing bundle size, compressing assets, caching efficiently, and reducing reflows and repaints. Using a CDN and image optimization also makes a big difference.
