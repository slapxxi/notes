**Q: What are generics in TypeScript?**

> Generics let you create reusable components that work with different data types while maintaining type safety. They're like templates in C++.

**Q: What's the difference between `interface` and `type`?**

> Both define object shapes, but interfaces are extendable and mergeable, while types are more flexible - they can represent unions, primitives, and tuples.

**Q: How do you handle optional and readonly properties in TypeScript?**

> You can mark them with `?` for optional and `readonly` to prevent reassignment. This improves both clarity and safety in your type definitions.
