## Kinematics

### Newton's Laws of Motion

1. A body tends to remain at rest or continue to move in a straight line at constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. This is the so-called concept of inertia.
2. The acceleration of a body is proportional to the resultant force acting on the body, and this acceleration is in the same direction as the resultant force.
3. For every force acting on a body (action) there is an equal and opposite reacting force (reaction), where the reaction is collinear to the acting force.

`F=ma`

The basic dimensions are _time_, _length_, and _mass_.

Acceleration is `L/T^2`

#### Mass

- Mass
- Center of Mass. The point in a body around which the mass of the body is evenly distributed. In mechanics, the center of mass is the point through which any force can act on the body without resulting in a rotation of the body.
- Moment of Intertia. It's a measure of a body's resistance to rotational motion.
