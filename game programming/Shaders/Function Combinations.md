1. Composition
2. Arithmetic Combination
3. Functional Transformation. You can manipulate functions by scaling (\* or /), shifting (+ or -), or compositing with constants.
4. Parameter-based blending. Use parameters to create smooth transitions or blends between functions.
5. Function composition chains
6. Differential and integral combinations. Combine functions through calculus operations.
