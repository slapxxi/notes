Here’s a comprehensive list of **Prepositional Conjunctions** (or **Subordinating Conjunctions**) with examples and advice on how to incorporate them into your speech:

---

### 1. **Because** (cause)

- **Usage Example**: _I stayed home **because** I was feeling sick._
- **Advice**: Use "because" to explain the reason for something. In your conversation, try to give clear reasons for your actions or decisions.

### 2. **Because of** (cause)

- **Usage Example**: _The event was canceled **because of** the weather._
- **Advice**: Use this when you want to give a specific reason for an action. It’s useful in both casual and formal contexts.

### 3. **Due to** (cause)

- **Usage Example**: _The flight was delayed **due to** a technical issue._
- **Advice**: This is often used in more formal settings. It can be used in professional or work-related conversations.

### 4. **In spite of** (contrast)

- **Advice**: Use this when you want to show a contrast between expectations and outcomes. It's helpful when explaining challenges or difficulties.

### 5. **Although** (contrast)

- **Usage Example**: _**Although** it was raining, they decided to go out._
- **Advice**: "Although" is used to introduce a contrast. It’s a more formal way of saying "but" and can help you show conflicting ideas or situations.

### 6. **Even though** (contrast)

- **Usage Example**: _**Even though** she was tired, she went to the gym._
- **Advice**: This is similar to "although" but adds more emphasis. Use it when you want to highlight a stronger contrast.

### 7. **Since** (time, cause)

- **Usage Example**: _**Since** we have no more coffee, we should buy some._
- **Advice**: "Since" is versatile—use it for both time references and causal relationships. It’s a good choice for everyday conversations to link ideas based on time or cause.

### 8. **As long as** (condition)

- **Usage Example**: _You can stay out **as long as** you’re home by midnight._
- **Advice**: This is helpful when you want to set conditions or limits in a conversation. It can be useful in discussions about permissions, plans, or agreements.

### 9. **In case** (condition)

### 10. **Unless** (condition)

- **Usage Example**: _I won’t go to the party **unless** I’m invited._
- **Advice**: "Unless" is great for expressing conditions that must be met for something to happen. It adds clarity and precision to your statements.

### 11. **As though** (manner, comparison)

- **Usage Example**: _He acts **as though** he knows everything._
- **Advice**: This can add a nuanced comparison or show how something appears. Use it when discussing hypothetical situations or giving impressions.

### 12. **As if** (manner, comparison)

- **Usage Example**: _She looked at me **as if** I had said something wrong._
- **Advice**: Similar to "as though," "as if" introduces hypothetical or imaginative situations. It's useful when making comparisons or describing someone's behavior.

### 13. **While** (time, contrast)

- **Usage Example**: _**While** I enjoy hiking, I prefer staying at home on weekends._
- **Advice**: "While" can introduce contrasts (similar to "although") or describe two actions happening at the same time. It’s very useful when balancing ideas.

### 14. **Before** (time)

- **Usage Example**: _I will call you **before** I leave the office._
- **Advice**: This is a straightforward time reference. It can be used to describe actions or events that need to occur earlier than another.

### 15. **After** (time)

- **Advice**: This is used to describe a point in time up to which something happens. It’s great for discussing time limits or continuous actions.

### 19. **By the time** (time)

- **Usage Example**: _**By the time** I get home, it will be dark._
- **Advice**: This phrase helps you reference an event or action that will occur before another. It’s useful when setting expectations in a conversation.

### 20. **If** (condition)

- **Usage Example**: _**If** it rains tomorrow, the picnic will be postponed._
- **Advice**: Use "if" for hypothetical situations or to show a condition that might lead to an outcome. It’s one of the most common subordinating conjunctions in English.

### 21. **In order that** (purpose)

- **Usage Example**: _He spoke slowly **in order that** everyone could understand._
- **Advice**: This is a more formal way to express purpose. Use it when you want to explain why something is done.

### 22. **So that** (purpose)

### **Incorporating Prepositional Conjunctions/Subordinating Conjunctions into Your Speech**

- **Practice Creating Complex Sentences**: Try combining two simple sentences using one of these conjunctions. For example: _I stayed home **because** I was tired._ → _I stayed home **because** I was tired, but I still managed to finish my report._
- **Use Conjunctions to Express Relationships**: Whether you’re explaining the **cause** of an event, the **contrast** between two situations, or the **condition** for something to happen, conjunctions will help you articulate your thoughts more clearly. Example: _I missed the meeting **due to** a traffic jam._
- **Link Related Ideas**: When telling a story or giving explanations, use these conjunctions to connect ideas logically. This will improve the flow of your conversation. Example: _I went to the gym **even though** I was exhausted from work._
- **Use in Professional Settings**: In interviews or formal settings, use these conjunctions to sound more articulate and organized. Example: _I believe I can handle the project **provided that** I receive all the necessary resources._
