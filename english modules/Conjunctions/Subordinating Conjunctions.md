### **Tips for Using Subordinating Conjunctions Effectively**

1. **Vary Your Sentence Structure**: Use subordinating conjunctions to make your sentences more complex and varied. This will improve the flow of your speech or writing.
    
2. **Ensure the Dependent Clause is Meaningful**: Make sure the dependent clause is important to the meaning of the sentence and provides context to the main clause.
    
3. **Punctuation**: If the dependent clause comes at the beginning of the sentence, use a comma to separate it from the main clause.  
    **Example**: _**Although** it was late, we decided to go out._  
    If the dependent clause comes at the end of the sentence, no comma is needed.  
    **Example**: _We decided to go out **although** it was late._
