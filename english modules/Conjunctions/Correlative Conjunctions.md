2. **Use Them to Sound More Natural**: Native speakers often use correlative conjunctions in everyday speech. Example: _I don't know **whether** he's coming **or** not._
3. **Use Them to Add Emphasis**: If you want to emphasize that two things are equally true, use _not only... but also..._ (e.g., _She is **not only** smart **but also** creative._)
