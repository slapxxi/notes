### **General Information About Conjunctions**

**Conjunctions** are words that link or connect words, phrases, clauses, or sentences. They help establish relationships between different parts of a sentence, making it more coherent and cohesive. Without conjunctions, sentences would be fragmented and harder to understand.

### **Types of Conjunctions**

1. **[[Coordinating Conjunctions]]**  
   These conjunctions link words, phrases, or clauses of equal importance or structure. They show a connection between two equal parts.

   **Common Coordinating Conjunctions:**

   - **For** (reason or cause)
   - **And** (addition)
   - **Nor** (neither…nor)
   - **But** (contrast)
   - **Or** (choice or alternative)
   - **Yet** (contrast or unexpected result)
   - **So** (result or effect)

   **Examples:**

   - She likes tea **and** coffee.
   - He didn't study, **so** he failed the test.
   - I wanted to go, **but** I had too much work.

2. **[[Subordinating Conjunctions]]**  
   These conjunctions introduce dependent (subordinate) clauses and show a relationship between the dependent and independent clause. They indicate the reason, time, condition, contrast, manner, or place of the action in the main clause.

   **Common Subordinating Conjunctions:**

   - **Because** (reason)
   - **Although**, **Though** (contrast)
   - **If** (condition)
   - **When**, **While** (time)
   - **As** (manner, degree, or comparison)
   - **Unless** (condition)
   - **Since** (reason, time)
   - **Before**, **After** (time)

   **Examples:**

   - She stayed home **because** she was sick.
   - **Although** it was raining, we went for a walk.
   - I’ll call you **if** I need help.

3. **[[Correlative Conjunctions]]**  
   These are pairs of conjunctions that work together to connect equal parts of a sentence. They express a relationship between two elements and must be used in pairs.

   **Common Correlative Conjunctions:**

   - **Both...and** (addition)
   - **Either...or** (choice)
   - **Neither...nor** (negation)
   - **Not only...but also** (emphasis, addition)
   - **Whether...or** (choice)
   - **As...as** (comparison)

   **Examples:**

   - **Both** my sister **and** I enjoy reading.
   - **Either** you go to the party **or** stay home.
   - He is **not only** smart, **but also** hardworking.

4. **[[Conjunctive Adverbs]]**  
   These are adverbs that function as conjunctions to link independent clauses. They are often used with a semicolon and a comma to connect ideas or show the relationship between two clauses.

   **Common Conjunctive Adverbs:**

   - **However**
   - **Therefore**
   - **Moreover**
   - **Consequently**
   - **Thus**
   - **For example**
   - **In fact**

   **Examples:**

   - He was late to the meeting; **however**, he still managed to give a great presentation.
   - I didn’t like the movie; **therefore**, I didn’t stay until the end.

5. **[[Prepositional Conjunctions]]**
   Prepositional conjunctions, also known as **prepositional subordinating conjunctions**, are conjunctions that are formed by the combination of prepositions and subordinating conjunctions. These words not only introduce subordinate clauses but also show a relationship between the main clause and the subordinate clause. They often indicate time, cause, condition, or contrast.

### **How to Use Conjunctions Effectively**

1. **Clarity and Flow**: Conjunctions help make sentences clearer by showing how different parts of a sentence are related. Using the right conjunction can make your writing and speech flow more smoothly.
2. **Combining Sentences**: Conjunctions allow you to combine short, choppy sentences into longer, more complex ones, making your communication more sophisticated and varied.
3. **Showing Relationships**: Whether you want to show contrast, cause and effect, time, or condition, conjunctions help express relationships between ideas, making it easier for the listener or reader to follow your argument.

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid with Conjunctions**

- **Avoid overusing conjunctions** like **and** or **but**. Using too many can make sentences feel repetitive and cluttered.
- **Watch for parallel structure**: When using correlative conjunctions, ensure that the structure on both sides of the conjunction is similar. For example, _"I like both swimming and running"_ (correct) vs. _"I like both swimming and to run"_ (incorrect).
