Incorporating phrasal verbs into your speaking can make your conversations sound more natural and fluent. Here are some strategies to help you practice using them in speech:

### 1. **Learn Common Phrasal Verbs**

Start with the most commonly used phrasal verbs. Focus on those that you can use in everyday situations. For example:

- **Get up** (to rise from bed)
- **Pick up** (to collect something or someone)
- **Turn on** (to activate)
- **Look after** (to take care of)
- **Come across** (to find unexpectedly)

**Practice:** Pick 3-5 phrasal verbs a day and try to use them in different sentences.

### 2. **Use Phrasal Verbs in Context**

Try to use them in realistic, everyday situations to make them feel more natural. For example, if you are having a conversation about work, try to use phrasal verbs like _carry out_ (to perform), _bring up_ (to mention), or _take over_ (to assume control).

**Example:** _"Can you pick up the phone? I need to finish this report."_

### 3. **Integrate Phrasal Verbs Into Your Routine**

Think about your daily activities and how you can describe them using phrasal verbs. When you’re speaking with someone, practice saying things like:

- _"I have to **pick up** my dry cleaning after work."_
- _"I’ll **turn off** the light before we leave."_
- _"Can you **look after** my dog while I’m on vacation?"_

### 4. **Roleplay Scenarios**

Practice in front of a mirror or with a language partner. Roleplay typical conversations where phrasal verbs would come up naturally. This could be a dialogue between you and a friend, or a scenario where you're giving directions, asking for help, or talking about plans.

**Example:** _"Where are we going to **pick up** the tickets?"_

### 5. **Focus on One Phrasal Verb at a Time**

Instead of trying to learn many phrasal verbs at once, focus on mastering one verb in various contexts. This way, you’ll be able to use it more naturally in conversations.

**Example:** Focus on _"turn on"_:

- _"Can you **turn on** the TV?"_
- _"I forgot to **turn on** the oven."_
- _"She always **turns on** the light when she enters the room."_

### 6. **Listen to Native Speakers**

Watch TV shows, movies, or listen to podcasts in English. Pay attention to how native speakers use phrasal verbs in different contexts. Take note of expressions you hear frequently and try to use them in your conversations.

**Example:** If you hear someone say _"I’ll **call off** the meeting because of the weather,"_ you can try using it in a similar situation.

### 7. **Use Phrasal Verbs in Different Tenses**

Be sure to practice phrasal verbs in various tenses (past, present, future) to get comfortable using them in different contexts.

**Example:**

- _Present:_ "I **pick up** my friend every day."
- _Past:_ "I **picked up** my friend yesterday."
- _Future:_ "I will **pick up** my friend tomorrow."

### 8. **Start with Simple Sentences**

When you're just starting to practice, keep your sentences simple. As you get more comfortable, you can start combining phrasal verbs with more complex structures.

**Example:**

- Simple: _"I need to **pick up** the phone."_
- Complex: _"I need to **pick up** the phone, but I’m in the middle of something right now."_

### 9. **Use Phrasal Verbs in Questions**

Incorporating phrasal verbs into your questions will help you get more practice using them in a conversational context.

**Example:** _"What time do you **wake up** every day?"_ or _"Where did you **pick up** that shirt?"_

### 10. **Practice with a Language Partner**

Speak with a language partner or tutor who can correct your use of phrasal verbs and encourage you to use them more often. You can also join language exchange groups or find online conversation partners.

### 11. **Record Yourself**

Record your conversations or short monologues where you try to use as many phrasal verbs as possible. Listening to yourself will help you identify areas for improvement.

### 12. **Stay Consistent**

Just like any other skill, incorporating phrasal verbs into your speaking takes time and consistency. Make it a habit to include at least one or two phrasal verbs in each conversation.

By following these steps, you'll gradually become more confident using phrasal verbs naturally in your conversations. Would you like me to help you practice with some examples or create specific situations for practicing phrasal verbs?
