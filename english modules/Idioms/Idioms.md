### **General Information About Idioms**

#### **What are Idioms?**

An **idiom** is a phrase or expression whose meaning is not directly derived from the meanings of the individual words within it. Instead, idioms often have a figurative or metaphorical meaning that differs from the literal interpretation. They are widely used in everyday language and can be specific to a particular culture, region, or language.

For example:

- **"Kick the bucket"** means to die, not to literally kick a bucket.
- **"Break the ice"** means to make people feel more comfortable in a social setting, not to physically break ice.
