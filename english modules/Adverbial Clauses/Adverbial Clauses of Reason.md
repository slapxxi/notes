| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Because**                | The most common way to state a reason                      | _She left early **because** she felt sick._                        |
| **Since**                  | Used when the reason is already known or obvious           | _I won’t go out, **since** it’s raining._                          |
| **As**                     | Provides background reason (more formal than "because")    | _As I was tired, I went to bed early._                             |

| **Seeing that**            | Introduces a reason that is evident from the situation     | _**Seeing that** she was busy, I didn’t disturb her._              |
| **Now that**               | Expresses a reason that results from a new situation       | _**Now that** we are home, let’s relax._                           |
| **Due to the fact that**   | A more formal way to say "because"                         | _He was absent **due to the fact that** he was ill._               |
| **In that**                | Used in formal or academic writing to specify the reason   | _The proposal was rejected **in that** it lacked clear data._      |
| **Owing to the fact that** | Similar to "due to the fact that" but slightly more formal | _The flight was delayed **owing to the fact that** there was fog._ |

## **3. How to Incorporate Adverbial Clauses of Reason into Speech**

1. **Use them to clarify your reasoning**: Instead of just saying _I left early_, explain why: _I left early **because** I wasn’t feeling well._
2. **Use different conjunctions for variety**: Instead of always using _because_, try _since_ or _as_ for a more natural flow (e.g., _As it was late, I went home._)
3. **Use formal conjunctions in professional settings**: In work or academic discussions, _due to the fact that_ or _in that_ can sound more precise and formal.
4. **Practice combining sentences**: If you often use two separate sentences to explain a reason, try linking them with adverbial clauses.
