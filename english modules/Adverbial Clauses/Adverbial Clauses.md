**Adverbial clauses** are dependent clauses that function as adverbs in a sentence, providing more information about the verb, adjective, or another adverb. They describe **how**, **when**, **where**, **why**, or to what **extent** something happens. These clauses are introduced by subordinating conjunctions, which connect them to the main clause.

### Key Features of Adverbial Clauses:

- **Dependent**: They cannot stand alone as a complete sentence and rely on the main clause for meaning.
- **Modify**: They modify a verb, adjective, or adverb in the main clause, giving additional information about the action or state described.
- **Introduced by Subordinating Conjunctions**: These are words like _because_, _although_, _if_, _when_, _while_, _before_, _after_, _as_, _until_, etc.
